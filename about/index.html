<h4>Background</h4>
<p>VFX and Animation studios typically integrate off the shelf digital content creation (DCC) tools, such as Maya or Houdini, with in-house software and other 3rd party packages to create a connected end-to-end pipeline for their artists. Since the late 90's an increasing number of studios have started running a flavour of Linux as their primary OS for artist workstations for reasons of reliability, flexibility, cost, performance and as a natural progression from SGI's IRIX.</p>
<p>Due to the flexibility of the Linux platform, there are a number of different distributions on varying release schedules and this combines with software vendors all having their own schedules to create a situation where DCC software packages are often released with different and incompatible dependencies. This complexity results in VFX studios requiring specialist expertise to integrate a pipeline around these dependencies or often even deciding against supporting Linux altogether.</p>
<p>Over recent years Linux platform requirements for DCC packages has mostly been led by Maya and other vendors typically followed its lead. In the run up to SIGGRAPH 2013, Autodesk joined together with Side Effects Software and The Foundry to create a working group to better align Linux support between the major software vendors. The Visual Effects Society Technology Committee was invited to join as an independent party to ensure the needs of the VFX industry was represented in the discussions.</p>
<p>This initiative has resulted in the VFX Reference Platform, a collection of major library and tool versions that are updated annually with the objective of being a common platform for all VFX and animation studios and software vendors to target. Initially this effort is focused on Linux only and is still being driven by a handful of software vendors. Once the platform is established, the longer term plan is to include more vendors earlier in the annual review cycle and also to create reference platforms for other operating systems.</p>

<h4>Goals</h4>
<p>The primary goals for the VFX Reference Platform are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Align software vendors to eliminate incompatibilities between common dependencies of DCC software.
<li>Reduce complexity and effort required to support Linux in VFX and Animation
<li>Lower the barrier to adopting Linux as a supported platform both for software vendors and end-user studios
<li>Create a transparent process, fairly representing the interests of both software vendors and end-user studios.
</ul>

<h4>Process</h4>
<p>The VFX Reference Platform process runs on an annual cycle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Q1 - Discussion on versions for next calendar year
<li>Q2 - Draft Reference Platform for the next year is published and feedback invited from vendors
<li>SIGGRAPH (July/Aug) - VFX Reference Platform for next year published
</ul>
<p>The draft and final references are decided by the VFX Reference Platform Working Group after considering all feedback. This Working Group is made up of interested parties invited by the VES Technology Committee and currently has four members, one representative each from:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.autodesk.com/">Autodesk</a>
<li><a href="http://www.sidefx.com/">Side Effects Software</a>
<li><a href="http://www.thefoundry.co.uk/">The Foundry</a>
